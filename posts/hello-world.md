# Welcome to My Markdown Blog!

This is my first blog post written in Markdown. This blog platform is built with **Hono.js** and supports full Markdown rendering.

## Features

- ✅ Markdown parsing and rendering
- ✅ Frontmatter metadata support
- ✅ Clean, responsive design
- ✅ Post listing and individual post views
- ✅ Automatic excerpt generation

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greetBlog() {
  console.log("Welcome to the Markdown Blog!");
  return "Hello, World!";
}

greetBlog();
```

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more content on this blog. Stay tuned for posts about:

1. Web development
2. JavaScript and TypeScript
3. Modern frameworks
4. Best practices
