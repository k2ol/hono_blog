- Added "Hello World" introductory post
- Created "Getting Started with Hono.js" technical post
- Added "Markdown Features Showcase" demonstration post
- All posts include frontmatter metadata (title, date, author, tags)

### Step 6: Application Integration - COMPLETED
- Updated src/index.ts to use blog routes
- Integrated all components into working blog platform

## Completed Features

### Core Functionality

- Frontmatter metadata support (title, date, author, tags)
- Automatic HTML generation from Markdown
- Responsive web design with clean styling
- Post listing with chronological sorting
- Individual post pages with full content
- Automatic excerpt generation for post previews
- Error handling for missing posts

### Technical Implementation
- Modular architecture with separate utilities and routes
- TypeScript support throughout
- Async file system operations
- Clean URL structure (/posts/slug-name)
- SEO-friendly HTML structure
- Mobile-responsive design

## Testing the Blog Platform

To test the completed blog platform:

1. Install dependencies: bun install
2. Start the development server: bun run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Available Routes:
- / - Homepage with recent posts
- /posts - All posts listing
- /posts/hello-world - Sample introductory post
- /posts/getting-started-with-hono - Technical post about Hono.js
- /posts/markdown-features - Markdown features demonstration

## Debugging and Resolution

### Issue Encountered:
- Missing 'marked' package dependency causing import errors
- PowerShell encoding issues preventing package installation

### Solution Implemented:
- Created fallback basic markdown parser for immediate functionality
- Updated debug.md with resolution steps
- Blog platform now works without external dependencies

## PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
