# Markdown Blog Platform Development Process

## Project Overview
Building a Markdown blog platform using Hono.js that can serve and render Markdown content as HTML blog posts.

## Development Tasks

### Phase 1: Basic Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize Hono.js application
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Configure package.json with dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Blog Features ✅
- [x] Create blog post storage system
- [x] Implement Markdown parsing and rendering
- [x] Create blog post routes (list, individual post)
- [x] Add basic HTML templates
- [x] Implement file-based blog post management

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features ✅
- [x] Add blog post metadata (title, date, author)
- [x] Implement blog post listing with chronological sorting
- [x] Add responsive design and professional styling
- [x] Create error handling for missing posts
- [ ] Add search functionality (future enhancement)
- [ ] Create admin interface for managing posts (future enhancement)

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies Used
- Hono.js for web framework
- Custom markdown parser (with marked as optional enhancement)
- TypeScript for type safety
- File system utilities for reading blog posts

### API Endpoints Implemented
- `GET /` - Homepage with recent blog posts
- `GET /posts` - List all blog posts
- `GET /posts/:slug` - Individual blog post

### Final File Structure

└── markdown-features.md
```

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Project Analysis ✅
- Analyzed existing Hono.js setup
- Identified need for markdown blog platform
- Created development roadmap

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies ✅
- Added `marked` package for Markdown parsing
- Updated package.json with required dependencies

### Step 3: Core Implementation ✅
- Created `src/utils/markdown.ts` for Markdown processing utilities
- Created `src/utils/posts.ts` for blog post management
- Implemented frontmatter metadata parsing
- Added automatic excerpt generation

### Step 4: Blog Routes ✅
- Created `src/routes/blog.ts` with complete blog functionality
- Implemented homepage with recent posts
- Added posts listing page
- Created individual post view with full content
- Added responsive HTML templates with clean styling

### Step 5: Sample Content ✅
- Created `posts/` directory with sample blog posts
- Added "Hello World" introductory post
- Created "Getting Started with Hono.js" technical post
- Added "Markdown Features Showcase" demonstration post
- All posts include frontmatter metadata (title, date, author, tags)

### Step 6: Application Integration ✅
- Updated `src/index.ts` to use blog routes
- Integrated all components into working blog platform

## Completed Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- File-based blog post system using Markdown files
- Frontmatter metadata support (title, date, author, tags)
- Automatic HTML generation from Markdown
- Responsive web design with clean styling
- Post listing with chronological sorting
- Individual post pages with full content
- Automatic excerpt generation for post previews
- Error handling for missing posts

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- Modular architecture with separate utilities and routes
- TypeScript support throughout
- Async file system operations
- Clean URL structure (/posts/slug-name)
- SEO-friendly HTML structure
- Mobile-responsive design

## Testing the Blog Platform

To test the completed blog platform:

1. Install dependencies: `bun install`
2. Start the development server: `bun run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Available Routes:
- `/` - Homepage with recent posts
- `/posts` - All posts listing
- `/posts/hello-world` - Sample introductory post
- `/posts/getting-started-with-hono` - Technical post about Hono.js
- `/posts/markdown-features` - Markdown features demonstration

## Debugging and Resolution

### Issue Encountered:
- Missing 'marked' package dependency causing import errors
- PowerShell encoding issues preventing package installation

### Solution Implemented:
- Created fallback basic markdown parser for immediate functionality
- Updated debug.md with resolution steps
- Blog platform now works without external dependencies
