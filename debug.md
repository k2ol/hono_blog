# Debug Log - Markdown Blog Platform

## Issue: Missing 'marked' package
**Problem**: Cannot find package 'marked' from markdown.ts
**Status**: RESOLVED

## Solution Applied:
1. **Temporary Fix**: Implemented basic markdown parser without external dependencies
2. **Production Fix**: Run `bun install` to install the marked package

## Current Status:
- Blog platform functional with basic markdown parsing
- All routes working (/, /posts, /posts/:slug)
- Sample posts created and accessible
- Responsive design implemented

## To Use Full Markdown Features:
1. Run: `bun install` (installs marked package)
2. Replace the basic parser with: `return marked(content);`
3. Restart the development server

## Testing Instructions:
1. Start server: `bun run dev`
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000
3. Navigate through homepage, posts list, and individual posts

## Known Limitations (with basic parser):
- Limited markdown feature support
- No syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Basic list and formatting support only

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. Install dependencies properly
2. Test full markdown rendering
3. Add additional blog features as needed
